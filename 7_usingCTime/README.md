# Exercise 3
Import the ``<ctime>`` library (like you did for ``cmath``)

### Suggestion
Research on some places (like stack overflow) some examples on ways that you can use the ctime library. Read the example, and determine your own idea.

### The example exercise
Determine someones birth year using the ctime library.

<i>Why not just get the current year from the user?</i> We were challenged to do this without input from the user.
