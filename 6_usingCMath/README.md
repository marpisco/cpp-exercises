# Exercise 3
Import the ``<cmath>`` library (like you do for ``<iostream>``), and mess around with some of the commands.

### Suggestion
Read [the reference guide](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_ref_math.asp) on the cmath library from w3schools.

### Some of the commands that I used as an example
max(minimum number,maximum number)
min(minimum number,maximum number)
sqrt(number)
round(number)
fmax(number)
abs(number)
