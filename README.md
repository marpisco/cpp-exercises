Over the past school year, I've started to learn how to program stuff in C++ in school.
It's a part of the course I'm taking, and it's actually something that I really enjoyed doing.

I'm sharing some exercises I've done on GitHub in order to allow you to learn a little bit of C++ with them. I hope that this really helps you in some way.

## Table of Contents
All of the exercises are within different folders, and what you're (or what I were) supposed to achieve is all in the **README.md** file present within that folder.

## License
TBA

## Credits
I've coded all of these projects myself. Any suggestions on what to add, or better ways to achieve stuff from the exercises?

Feel free to make a **pull request** and I'll be happy to merge it.
